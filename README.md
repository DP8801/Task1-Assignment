# Task1-Assignment
This include all the basic programs of python

## Task 1.1 (Python Basics)
1. Write a program to print your name
2. Write a program for a Single line comment and multi-line comments
3. Define variables for different Data Types int, Boolean, char, float, double and print on the Console.
4. Define the local and Global variables with the same name and print both variables and understand the scope of the variable

## Task 1.2 (Operators)
1. Write a function for arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/)
2. Write a method for increment and decrement operators(++, --)
   > NOTE: There is no implicit increment or decrement in Python as in conventional programming language although it have a short hand for icrement and decrement
3. Write a program to find the two numbers equal or not
4. Program for relational operators (<,<==, >, >==)
5. Print the smaller and larger number

## Task 1.3 (Loops)
1. Write a program to print “Bright IT Career” ten times using for loop
2. Write a program to print 1 to 20 numbers using the while loop
3. Program to equal operator and not equal operators
4. Write a program to print the odd and even numbers.
5. Write a program to print largest number among three numbers.
6. Write a program to print even number between 10 and 20 using while
7. Write a program to print 1 to 10 using the do-while loop statement
   > NOTE : Python doesn't have do-while loop. But we can create a program by while loop. The do while loop is used to check condition after executing the statement. It is like while loop but it is executed at least once.
8. Write a program to find Armstrong number or not
9. Write a program to find the prime or not
10. Write a program to palindrome or not
11. Program to check whether a number is EVEN or ODD using switch
    > NOTE : Python don't have switch case
12. Print gender (Male/Female) program according to given M/F using switch
    > NOTE : No switch case in python
